# Bayesian Data Analysis & Cognitive Modeling

## Overview

The course introduces main ideas and tools of Bayesian data analysis. Using Bayesian inference to draw inference from obervational data makes it possible, in fact strongly encourages, using all domain-specific and task-relevant knowledge we as modellers may have. In this way, the Bayesian way of analyzing data quickly blurs the boundary between standard statistical analyses and custom-made generative models of the data-generating process. This course will focus on probabilstic cognitive models for applications.
